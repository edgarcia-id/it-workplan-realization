**A management reporting tool designed for IT Managers to present planned programs, actual execution, and KPI success rates to executives.**

### 🧐 Why this tool?
As an IT Leader, technical reports (server logs, lines of code) mean very little to the Board of Directors. 
Management speaks in targets, realizations, and percentages.
This tool bridges that communication gap by allowing IT Managers to:
1.  **Define the Plan:** Set Monthly (RKB) or Weekly (RKM) targets.
2.  **Track Realization:** Document what was actually achieved.
3.  **Generate Executive Summaries:** Automatically calculate KPI Success Rate and export to a clean, landscape PDF ready for board meetings.

### 🛠️ Features
* **Status Indicators:** Clear visual tags (Done, In Progress, Delayed).
* **Automatic KPI Calculation:** Converts completed tasks into a Success Rate percentage.
* **Landscape PDF Export:** Optimized layout for wide tables and executive signatures.
